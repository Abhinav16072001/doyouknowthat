        UPSC Civil Service Entrance Examinations (IAS)
      </h2>

      <img src="../../images/Top 5 Toughest Exams in India/2.jpg" width="600px" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="...">

      <p>
       The Civil Services Examination (CSE) is a nationwide competitive examination in India conducted by the Union Public Service Commission for recruitment to various Civil Services of the Government of India, including the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Foreign Service, and Indian Police Service. <br><br> Also simply referred to as the UPSC examination, it is conducted in three phases - <br> <br>
<ul style="list-style: square;">
  
  <li>Preliminary examination consisting of two objective-type papers (General Studies Paper I and General Studies Paper II also popularly known as Civil Service Aptitude Test or CSAT)</li>
  <li>Main examination consisting of nine papers of conventional (essay) type, in which two papers are qualifying and only marks of seven are counted</li>
  <li>Personality test (interview)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Aspirants are required to cover a large syllabus, with Indian History, Indian Geography, and Laws on Human Rights considered to be the crucial subjects. On average, 900,000 to 1,000,000 candidates apply every year and the number of candidates sitting in the preliminary examination is approximately 550,000.<br><br>
The responsibilities of those working in central government services such as the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Foreign Service, the Indian Police Service, etc require you to have diverse skills, deep knowledge, and strong resilience to handle them. This is why both the UPSC IAS exams as well as their processes are naturally tough and claustrophobic.

      <p>

GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. <br><br>
        The GATE score obtained is valid for 3 years, starting from the announcement date. It’s also accepted by selected government PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings).
        Before enrolling for the exam, there are some eligibility criteria you need to meet. Although there is no age limit, ensure you meet at least one of the following criterion:

        CAT (Common Entrance Test)
      </h2>

      <img src="../../images/Top 5 Toughest Exams in India/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width="600px" alt="...">

      <p>
        The Common Admission Test (CAT)[2] is a computer based test for admission in a graduate management program. The test consists of three sections:<br>
        <ul style="list-style: square;">
          <li>Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC)</li>
          <li>Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR) </li>
          <li>Quantitative Ability (QA)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CAT is an entry-level exam which is a great gateway for admissions to premium management and business schools in India. Candidates are evaluated based on skills in English, Mathematics, and Logical Reasoning.</p>
      </p>
      <p>CAT exam scores are accepted by IIMs and other similar universities and institutes offering courses on MBA. Every year, only a staggering 1,500 candidates out of 2 lakhs succeed in obtaining admissions to IIMs annually. If we had to calculate the success rate in percentages, then we’d conclude that the success rate is close to 2% only.</p>
      <b>Eligibility for CAT:</b>
      <p>
        <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li>Hold a bachelor's degree, with no less than 50% or equal CGPA</li>
        <li>The degree should be granted by any of the universities consolidated by an act of the central or state statutory body in India or other instructive organizations built up by an act of Parliament or pronounced to be considered as a university under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956, or possess an equivalent qualification recognized by the Ministry of HRD, Government of India.</li>
        <li>Competitors appearing for the final year of bachelor's degree/equivalent qualification examination and the individuals who have finished degree prerequisites and are anticipating results can likewise apply.</li>

      <p>
        The National Defence Academy (NDA) is the joint defence service training institute of the Indian Armed Forces, where cadets of the three services i.e. the Indian Army , the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force train together before they go on to respective service academy for further pre-commission training. The NDA is located in Khadakwasla, Pune, Maharashtra. <b>It is the first tri-service academy in the world</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It intends to check the students' creativity levels in design. They are ranked based on merit provided through the test.<br>
        NID offers course admissions to aspirants, such as:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li>Master of Design (MDes)</li>
        <li>Bachelor of Design (BDes)</li>
        <li>Graduate Diploma Programme in Design (GDPD)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But if you want to obtain a seat for those programmes, then you’ll need to write two exams: </p>
      <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li>NID DAT Prelims
            <p>Prelims is conducted to test a candidate’s qualities and attributes on design. Mostly their knowledge and comprehension of the subjects involved, their analytical and creative thought process, and their visualisation skills. Qualifiers can then appear for the Mains exam.</p>
        </li>

        <li>NID DAT Main
          <p>Mains is largely a studio test, and is also dependent on the specialisation that the candidate went for. The interview itself is conducted by the faculty or the official head of their respective specialisation. The reason why there’s pressure involved is because a total of 100 seats are allotted based on merit for BDes in Industrial Design, Communication Design, Textile, and/or Apparel & Lifestyle Accessory Design departments.

For the number of candidates applying for a seat in these programmes, that number is way too less. This means that the elimination procedure is likely to be strict.</p>
