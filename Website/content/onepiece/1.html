        The Diverse Cast Caters To A Wide Audience

       If free-spirited characters like Monkey D. Luffy aren't your thing, there's no need to worry. The ensemble cast of One Piece is sprawling, so chances are good you'll find some other reoccuring character to love. In the ever-growing Straw Hat Pirate crew, there's the greedy yet level-headed Nami, the strong-willed former pirate hunter Zoro, the suave chef Sanji, and the brilliant, adorable, ferocious reindeer Tony Tony Chopper, to name a few. The supporting casts for each storyline are always filled with winners, and even minor characters can be amazingly memorable.

      <h2>The Story Isn't As Childish As It May Seem</h2>

      <p>
        Compared to overtly-gritty Shonen Jump series like Naruto or Bleach, One Piece sticks out like a sore thumb, since its cartoony aesthetic can cause new viewers to think the show is meant for younger audiences. While the story has a playful demeanor, it still manages to include some crushingly heavy subject matter from time to time. 

Many characters' backstories are filled with cruelty and tragedy. A young Nami watched her adopted mother die at the hands of pirate invaders, and Brook witnessed all his compatriots slowly waste away from a deadly poison, then awakened a year later in a pile of their rotted corpses. 

The show's battles are no less grisly. Who would have thought a rubber man could bleed so much? Villains are appropriately brutal, and the Straw Hat Pirates aren't afraid to break a couple necks if it means stopping a power-hungry dictator from taking over the World Government. If the show didn't understand how to perfectly interweave moments of comedy and tragedy, it might be too bleak to watch.

        The Fantasy Setting Is Unique And Compelling
      </h2>

      <p>
        Even though One Piece is inspired by the real-life Golden Age Of Piracy (roughly 1650-1720), the series takes some liberties to create a semi-historical fantasy world. The All Blue is a dangerous sea that houses a multitude of fantasy islands and mythical creatures. According to legend, the All Blue is the only place in the world where the North, South, East, and West seas converge, and fish from all four areas live in harmony there. 

Even the non-mythical regions are filled with wonder. The area surrounding the Grand Line is protected by monstrous creatures known as the Sea Kings, all of whom are completely unique. On top of that, real-world technology is often replaced by strange beasts, such as the Den Den Mushi snails, who can relay communications in a manner that closely resembles modern-day cell phones. One Piece knows how to borrow interesting aspects from a historical period without getting bogged down by the rules of reality.

        The Story Is Loaded With Moments Of Emotional Resilience

        The Straw Hat Pirate crew is composed of dreamers. Luffy wants to be King of the Pirates, Zoro vows to become the world's greatest swordsman, and Nami dreams of charting the entire world. Each member has endured personal tragedy, and it's inspiring to see them rebound and strive for new heights. 

Despite their successes, the crew's journey is loaded with heart-breaking moments, such as when they lose their prized ship, or when they're forced to split up for two years. These tearful moments don't dissuade them from pursuing their dreams, and when they do triumph, their victories feel well-earned.

      <p>
        While One Piece isn't afraid to get dark, the show is also filled with hilarious moments, and its comedic timing is perfect. There are tons of running gags, such as Sanji's endless string of romantic failures, and the scene where the Straw Hat Pirates fuse to form a giant robot has to be seen to be believed

        <p class="card-text">Though shonen can often be derided for its formulaic nature, it still remains one of the most popular anime genres of them all. That’s due in no large part to most of the series knowing what they’re best at and sticking to it: Impressive fight scenes, strong and often likable character archetypes, and powerful stories surrounding themes of friendship, family, and being an all-around decent person.</p>
